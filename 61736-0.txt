                                PREFACE


The architect of today, in designing small houses, is beset with
many exactions and complications. The high standard of living
with its embarrassing variety of materials and appliances at the
architect's disposal, the certainly high cost of labor and the desire
for mechanical perfection and convenience, the client who knows too
much and too little, and the passing fashions of revived styles and
periods, all increase the difficulty of producing houses that fulfill
requirements, satisfy clients, and at the same time have order,
simplicity and appropriateness to surroundings.

The designers and builders of the old Bermuda houses had relatively
few of these complications to contend with. Their pursuits were for
the most part agricultural and seafaring, and their manner of life
and their luxuries were simple. A generally mild climate, a fertile
soil, and easily worked building stone always at hand, lime readily
obtained, a plentiful supply of beautiful and durable wood, and cheap
labor simplified their building problem. Traditions, if any, were those
of English rural architecture, and these, interpreted by shipwrights
rather than housebuilders, applied to island materials and island life,
have helped to give to the older buildings of Bermuda a particular
interest and charm, and have developed an architecture worthy of
perpetuation.

The photographs presented in this book have been taken with the idea of
collecting and preserving for architects and others interested in small
buildings some of the characteristic features and picturesque aspects
of the older architecture of the island that are tending to disappear.
Many of the older houses are being altered and modernized ruthlessly,
or without thought of preserving the old Bermudian character of
architecture; others are falling into decay through neglect.

Bermuda is now prosperous, not only through its resources of
agriculture in supplying northern markets with winter produce, but
also from the great number of tourists and the number of permanent
winter residents and house owners that bids fair to increase. Many
of the newer houses built in different parts of the island are of
the "suburban villa" type, commonplace and smug, devoid of interest,
and though not large houses, are so large in scale as to dominate
and destroy the small scale of the natural surroundings or of nearby
Bermudian architecture. Self conscious "Italian Renaissance," "Spanish
Mission" and even "Tudor Gothic" and "Moorish" have put in appearance
in some of the more pretentious, newer places.

If Bermuda's prosperity continues to increase, it is to be hoped that
the designers of new houses that appear will seek their inspiration in
Bermuda's own older architecture. It is eminently appropriate to the
climate and other local conditions, harmonious and in scale with the
surroundings. It has the unity, charm and simplicity of an architecture
that is the unaffected expression and natural outcome of environment,
and, from its simplicity, is entirely adaptable to the modern
requirements of Bermuda. Architecture such as Italian Renaissance,
Gothic and Moorish, referred to above, has no artistic excuse for
existing in Bermuda.

To those who are familiar with Bermuda and the houses there, these
colorless photographs may be but sorry representations of the
actuality, and can only serve to stimulate memory. White, or softly
tinted houses with weathered green blinds and doors, frequently buried
in luxuriant foliage and blossoms of vivid hues, with glistening white
roofs silhouetted against intensely blue sky, or backed against the
dull green of red trunked cedars, through which may be glimpses of a
turquoise sea, make a strong impression on the senses, but fail to
register with the camera--even when held by a more experienced hand
than that of the author.




                            HISTORICAL NOTE


What is now known as Bermuda, sometimes called the Bermudas and at
one time known as Somers Islands, is a group of islands said to be
over three hundred in actual number, lying in the Atlantic some seven
hundred miles southeast from New York, the nearest point on the
mainland being Cape Hatteras, in North Carolina, five hundred and
seventy miles west. Of these three hundred odd islands, the eight
principal ones, totalling in area less than twenty square miles, lie
close together and are now connected by bridges, causeways and ferries.
A glance at the map of Bermuda shows its general form, with its three
almost enclosed bodies of water, the Great Sound, Harrington Sound and
Castle Harbor, and nautical charts with soundings marked would show its
form extending as reefs under water into a great oval connecting the
two ends. These reefs made actual landing difficult, giving the island
an evil reputation before its settlement, and no doubt were the cause
of many shipwrecks.

The islands were known to exist as early as 1511, as they were noted
on a map of that date. They received their name, however, from Juan de
Bermudez, who came to Spain with an account of them a few years later,
although there is apparently no evidence to show that the Spaniards or
Portuguese ever occupied the islands or even landed there.

In 1593, Henry May, an Englishman, was cast away there with others and,
eventually making his way back to England, he published an account of
his adventures and a description of the group of Islands. Bermuda thus
became known to the English. In 1609, the "Sea Venture" which was one
of nine ships bound for the infant plantation of Virginia, with a party
of "adventurers" ran ashore on Bermuda in a hurricane. The admiral of
this fleet, Sir George Somers, with Sir Thomas Gates sent out to govern
Virginia, and the entire company and crew of the "Sea Venture," said to
number 149 men and women, were landed. With the ship stores saved from
the wreck and what the island gave them, this company subsisted there
for some ten months. During this time and in spite of mutiny among
his charges, two ships were built under Somers' direction, and in May,
1610, the Company proceeded to the original destination, the colony of
Virginia.

The Virginia colonists were in straits through lack of food, and Somers
returned to Bermuda for provisions for the colony, having found hogs
and fish plentiful on the islands. He died there in 1611, and his
followers returned to England soon after.

The glowing and exaggerated accounts of the richness of the islands
brought back by these colonists excited the cupidity of the organizers
of the Virginia Company, who enlarged their original charter to include
Bermuda and established a Colony there under Governor Moore in 1612.
The shipment home of ambergris by Moore seemed to confirm the reported
wealth of the islands, so that, following a method not unknown to
more modern exploiters, members of the Virginia Company soon formed
a new sub-company which took over the title to Bermuda as a separate
proprietary colony, under the name of "The Governor and Company of the
City of London, for the Plantation of the Somers Islands."

In 1616, Daniel Tucker was sent out by this company as the first
Governor under the new charter. He caused the islands to be surveyed,
dividing them into eight tribes, and public lands. These tribes, or
proportional parts, assigned to each charter member, were for the most
part what are the present-day parishes, being Sandys, to Sir Edwin
Sandys; Southampton, to the Earl of Southampton; Paget, to William,
Lord Paget; Smith's, to Sir Thomas Smith; Pembroke, to the Earl of
Pembroke; Bedford, now Hamilton Parish, to the Countess of Bedford;
Cavendish, now Devonshire, to Lord William Cavendish; Mansils', now
Warwick, to Sir Robert Mansil. St. George's, St. David's and adjacent
small islands were public lands. The tribes were subdivided into fifty
shares of twenty-five acres each. Norwood's second map showing these
tribes and shares is the basis of land titles in Bermuda today.

Governor Tucker's rule was harsh. The colonists included many criminals
and convicts from English jails, so a merciless discipline seemed
to him necessary. The severest penalties were enforced, executions,
brandings and whippings were frequent. Negro slaves were introduced
from Virginia in the endeavor to make money for the proprietors, with
the resultant vices leaving their trail to this day. Progress was made
in building the town of St. George. Roads and fortifications were
constructed and the land planted with tobacco and semi-tropical fruits.

Tucker was replaced by Nathaniel Butler in 1619, but after securing his
title to property rather doubtfully acquired, returned to Bermuda where
he died in 1632. It was probably during Butler's term that the first
stone dwellings began to appear, replacing the earlier thatched roofed
cedar houses.

"The history of the colony from 1620, when the first Assembly met,
until 1684, or 1685, when the Company was ousted of its charter by _quo
warranto_ in the King's Bench in England, is made up of the struggles
of the Company in London to make as much out of the colonists as
possible; of the struggles of the colonists to remove restrictions
on trade with others than the Company, imposed upon them by the
proprietaries; and of the efforts of the Governors sent out to the
islands to maintain order, enforce the rules of the Company and defend
their authority and exercise too often arbitrary power."--(_William
Howard Taft._)

From 1685 on, the island became self-governing and was largely left to
its own devices by England. Agriculture was neglected or left in the
hands of ignorant slaves, while the white islanders were occupied in
such maritime pursuits as whaling, fishing and shipbuilding, and were
dependent to a great extent on the mainland of America, with which they
were in constant contact.

The outbreak of the American Revolution brought divided opinion on
the islands as on the mainland. There is, however, little doubt but
that there was great sympathy for the cause of freedom in the American
colonies. Secret aid was given and commercial relations were resumed
with America before the close of the war. If the Continental Congress
had possessed a considerable navy, or if the islands had lain closer to
the mainland, they might this day have been part of the United States.
As it was, they remained ostensibly loyal to the mother country.

The War of 1812 brought changes to Bermuda. She became a port for
prizes taken by the British navy and later was intermediary port
for trade between America and the West Indies with the result that
Bermudians prospered in the shipping trade. To the English, this war
called attention to Bermuda's strategic position, and a naval station
was established there. Convict labor from England was used to build
dock yards, fortifications and roads, to the general benefit of the
whole island. Slavery was abolished in 1834, an act which, though a
general advantage, hurt Bermudian shipping, compelling, as it did, the
employment at pay of sailors. With this decline of shipping attention
was again turned to agriculture.

The Civil War brought a great period of activity and prosperity to
Bermuda. Through ties of blood and trade, sympathy was entirely with
the South and the ports were full of blockade runners bringing cotton
from the South for trans-shipment to England. The crews spent much of
their high wages on the islands and the Bermudians also engaged in the
gamble of blockade running. The end of the war brought losses to many,
and Bermuda again settled down to its normal activities, agriculture
and fishing.

In later years a new source of revenue to Bermuda has arisen, known
there as the "tourist trade," and consisting in providing for the needs
and desires of visitors to the island. This has grown to important
size and promises a still further increase. The mild climate and charm
of beautiful surroundings, excellent steamship service and luxurious
modern hotels, attract thousands each year. Building is being revived
and Bermuda's commercial future seems assured.

                            BERMUDA HOUSES


Bermuda has been written about from many points of view. Its
interesting discovery and history have been written and rewritten;
its volcanic origin investigated, discussed, tested and settled by
able minds. The plant life existing there, the remarkably varied
and beautiful aquatic life, has had its share of attention from
scientists, and as an attraction is exploited for the amusement of
visitors. The mild climate and hospitality to travellers has not
lacked acclaimers and advertisement, and entirely adequate guide-books
giving miscellaneous information of interest can be obtained without
difficulty.

Bermuda's houses, however, seem to have had little attention called
to them. A number of picture post-cards, it is true, exist, but these
are misleading in that the views are chosen to show the islands as
tropical, and the cards are colored by commercial "artists" who
presumably have never seen the place. Some recent magazine articles
have also slightly touched this interesting and characteristic part of
old Bermuda.

The casual visitor and "tripper" cannot help being struck by the charm
of the older buildings of the island, and the picturesque element
that they add to many views through the entire fitness in scale and
design to their surroundings. To students in architecture they present
many points of singular interest and beauty. The architecture is in
no sense grand, nor is it even important compared to that of other
lands. Its interest lies chiefly in the fact that it is a very simple,
straight-forward and complete expression and outcome of a number of
unusual conditions and factors that were a marked and characteristic
part of the earlier life of the colony. These factors were the climate,
the unusual geological formation and structure of the island, and to a
lesser degree the economic and social conditions under which the island
had its early development.

The climate is a mild and humid one, with abundant rainfall, with a
fairly even temperature throughout the year, varying not more than
35 degrees or so, subject, however, to high winds and occasional
hurricanes. With a fertile though rather scanty soil, agriculture
has been carried on with varying degrees of success since the first
settling of the island, though it appears the island was never wholly
self-supporting in this respect. Fishing, whaling and shipbuilding were
other pursuits carried on until recent times.

The local indigenous cedar, that still predominates and originally
covered the island, afforded a lumber that could be used for
housebuilding purposes, as well as giving an excellent wood for
shipbuilding and for furniture. Many interesting pieces of furniture,
in native cedar, made by island cabinetmakers, still exist.

The islands are formed of soft stone and sand with a thin surface of
soil, the whole resting on a volcanic substructure of extreme age.
The so-called "coral" of which the islands are formed is in reality
a true Ãolian limestone, formed of wind-drifted shell sand with a
small percentage of coral material. This stone occurs throughout the
islands, varying in compactness and suitability for building purposes,
but the hardest of it is easily quarried, cut into blocks for walls
and slabs for roofing tiles, by handsaws, and may be trimmed with
hatchet and adze. It is too soft and brittle to lend itself readily
to fine ornament. For this reason Bermuda's houses show few purely
ornamental motives in stone. In some of them there are semicircular
arched projections over windows, called "eyebrow" windows, and a few
crude pediment forms used as decorations. Finials on gable ends are
not uncommon, but in any case all forms of carving are reduced to
the lowest terms of simplicity. Mouldings on the exterior or moulded
cornices on buildings seem to have come only with the advent of
Portland cement. Some of the gateposts have coarse mouldings cut in
stone.

Though the stone, when exposed to air, hardens somewhat, it remains too
soft and porous to stand well without protection. When burned it gives
an excellent lime, which is used with sand as a mortar in which to set
the stone, and as a stucco inside and out to protect from moisture and
disintegration, and finally as a whitewash for finish and cleanliness.

Besides the influence on building forms that this stone had, as
a universally available and easily worked material, its presence
throughout the island had another effect. In spite of abundant
rainfall, the stone structure of the island is so porous that there is
no natural accumulation of fresh water resulting in an entire absence
of springs and streams, so that the inhabitants have been at all times
dependent on catching and storing rain water. Thus each roof serves
not only its usual protective purpose, but must also serve to catch
fresh water. The result is a feature, a marked Bermudian characteristic
of roofs immaculate with whitewash and a system of gutters leading to
that necessary adjunct of every Bermuda dwelling, "the tank."

The form of roofs employed varies considerably. Roofs with gable end
and hipped roofs are both used, sometimes in the same building. There
seems to be no generally adopted angle of pitch. One finds roofs almost
flat and in different degrees of steepness to the sixty degree pitch
of some of the outhouses and butteries. The roof surfaces are never
interrupted by dormer windows.

The roof spans are in no cases large, rarely exceeding eighteen feet,
probably governed by the limited sizes of the cedar lumber available
for floor beams, but in any case apparently quite sufficient for the
needs of the inhabitants. This smallness of span forced a smallness
of division in plan, and contributed to the general small scale, a
characteristic of island architecture referred to elsewhere.

The roof construction consisted of rather light sawn or hewn rafters,
either butted at the summit or framed into a ridgepole, and securely
fastened to a heavy plate placed on the inside line of the masonry
wall. These rafters were tied over interior walls or partitions by long
ties at the plate level, but elsewhere by ties placed too high up for
structurally efficient service, with consequent thrust at the ends and
irregular sagging of rafters. This was done for the purpose of allowing
the ceilings of the rooms enclosed to run well up into what otherwise
would have been dead roofspace, giving the rooms a surprising height
and airiness in spite of low eaves. This form of ceiling, finished
either in plaster or wood, gives rise to the not ungraceful, so-called
"tray" ceilings, from a fancied resemblance to a serving tray. These, I
think, are peculiar to old Bermuda, and Bermudians point them out with
pride to visitors.

In the carpentry of many of the roofs, construction details of the
shipwright rather than the carpenter prevail. Bermudians of the
older days were well known for the excellence of their sloops and
smaller sailing vessels, and one sees constantly the introduction of
shipbuilding ideas in their houses--cedar knees locking at the angles,
the timbers serving as roof plates, and tie-beams with the gentle curve
or camber of a deck beam, are not infrequent.

The surface of the roof is constructed of sawn slabs or tiles of
Bermuda stone about one and a half inches thick, by some ten inches
to a foot in width with a length slightly greater, known locally
as "slates." These are fastened to strips of cedar set transversely
to the rafters at proper intervals. An occasional slate is slightly
raised, to secure necessary ventilation of enclosed roof space. These
roof tiles usually overlap in the fashion of slates or shingles in
horizontally parallel rows, but sometimes are laid flat with butting
edges. The eaves have but a small projection of six to ten inches, and
are supported on stubby square sectioned jack-rafters projecting from
above the plate line to the edge of the tiling above. With the plate
on the inside of the wall, this arrangement gives a shadow at the eave
line that is decorative in its varying intensity, without the use of
any mouldings whatever. In all likelihood, however, this type of eave,
so different from the greatly projecting eaves of other sunny climates,
was adopted to prevent the occasional hurricanes from unroofing the
houses.[1]

[Footnote 1: In spite of this a hurricane of unusual violence destroyed
many roofs in September, 1922, uprooted hundreds of fine cedars and
other trees and did thousands of pounds damage generally.]

The whole roof surface is heavily coated with semi-liquid cement, which
when it hardens serves to make the roof water-tight and softens the
edges and angles to the eye. This, when freshly whitewashed, gives to
the roofs the resemblance to "icing on a cake" spoken of by Mark Twain.

From the engineering point of view, the construction of the roofs may
not be mechanically scientific, but whatever the deficiencies, the
lack of precision and exactness has given to them that delightful
quality of accidental irregularity and unevenness that is the despair
of architects for new work, and can hardly be obtained by even obvious
affectation.

One of the characteristic and frequent adjuncts to Bermuda dwellings
are the butteries. These are sometimes joined to the main building, but
are often detached elements, and are, I believe, in the form that they
appear on the islands, peculiar to Bermuda though Sicily is said to
have somewhat similar out buildings. They are small two-story buildings
with thick walls and small openings, with high pyramidal roofs, built
by a series of inwardly encorbled courses of heavy masonry and present
a decidedly monumental appearance. They were built before the days of
ice, as a place to keep perishable food cool. Elevated and pierced with
small shuttered openings to catch the breezes, they had thick walls and
roofs as defense against the sun's rays.

The chimneys area prominent feature, particularly in the smaller
houses. Open fireplaces with hearths waist high were used for cooking,
and are still in use for this purpose in some places, although oil
stoves are generally replacing them.

The kitchen fireplace was accompanied by a built-in stone oven with
its own flue, sometimes beside the kitchen fireplace, with independent
chimney, and sometimes opening into it. The sides of these fireplaces
sloped gently to a flue, so large and deep, that it carried off heat
as well as the acrid smoke of burning cedar. Where the slave quarters
were in the basement or cellar, there was a separate cooking fireplace
for their use, so that even many of the small houses had two chimneys.
In the larger houses of the more well-to-do, where slaves were owned
in greater numbers, they were lodged in a separate building, and the
owner's house usually had fireplaces to warm and dry the house during
the colder weeks of winter. These fireplaces were of large size, with
a raised hearth and no outer hearth. With the soft stone, the walls
of the chimneys were necessarily thick, which gives them a prominence
at first somewhat surprising for a sub-tropical climate. Chimneys
projecting from the roof seemingly became a necessity to satisfy
appearances, even when no real chimney existed. In many of the smallest
houses, little false chimneys placed at the point of the hip are used
as ornament to the roof.

Buttresses occur not infrequently and add to the character of the
houses as well as having the structural function of overcoming the
outward thrust of the rafters, that might otherwise be too great for
the stability of the walls. These buttresses are sometimes reduced to
salient pilasters on the thinner walls of the second story or pilasters
of decided projection the full height of the house.

The ground plan of the smaller house presents little of great interest;
in most cases a simple succession of intercommunicating rectangular
rooms on the living floor; the kitchen dining room at one end
distinguished by a large open cooking fireplace and built-in oven.

A greater number of rooms was obtained by adding projecting wings to
the original plan. This was usually done in a rather haphazard fashion,
but frequently with a distinct feeling of symmetry and order. The
following diagrams show a number of such results that recur time and
again with variations of gable and hip. The irregular additions were
of great variety, sometimes producing by chance masses that composed
in picturesque fashion. At other times the final outcome of successive
additions was less fortunate with its complication of roofs and
gutters. But the usual luxuriance of surrounding planting, the patina
of age, and the very naÃ¯vetÃ© of arrangement makes even these acceptable.

Where the house was located on sloping ground, which was a frequent and
deliberate choice of site as protection from the force of hurricanes
the living floor was approximately at the higher level of the slope,
necessitating a high basement wall on the lower side. This basement
space, partially cut out from the natural rock, damp and almost totally
dark, and with no direct connection to the floor above, was originally
used for slave quarters with its own cooking fireplace, or for storage
purposes. In the present day this lower part is little used. In some
cases it makes shift for a stable, and more rarely, where conditions
have permitted, is made into habitable rooms and connected by a
stairway with the main floor.

  [Illustration: PLATE 3. Diagrams of Typical Houses.]

This form of building on a slope gives rise to another feature of
many of the older houses, namely, the long flight of exterior steps,
connecting the living floor with the lower ground level. These have
brick risers and treads and substantial stone parapets with the landing
at the top sometimes expanded to form a small terrace, or more rarely
a covered veranda. These steps are as a rule much wider at the bottom
than the top, with consequent diverging railing or parapet wall. On
the landing itself, the walls have frequently an outward slant, giving
a peculiar, tub-like effect. This stairway, or "stoop," as it would
be called in some parts of America, with the outstretching sidewalls
is known in Bermuda as "Welcoming Arms," significant of Bermudian
hospitality.

Another frequent feature was the projecting vestibule or waiting room
in many of the houses of early date. This was a small room, square or
half octagon in plan, that stood open to the visitor at all times, for
shelter from sun and rain. The door from this to the rest of the house
was the occupant's protection from intrusion. This room is said to have
been furnished with chairs and table, and a hand bell, with which the
caller announced his presence.

The infrequency of verandas or other roofed-over outdoor space is
noticeable to the visitor from America, to whom this seems a very
modest luxury, if not a necessity for ordinary comfort. In many cases
where verandas now exist, they are additions to the house as first
built. The original occupant and builder of these houses found indoors
cooler and more comfortable in hot weather than any veranda, as
screening against insects was then unknown. If he preferred outdoors,
the shade of a tree or the north side of the house was sufficient. The
sunshine was welcome in the winter to warm and dry the house, and in
summer the prevailing wind was from the south and equally desirable.
Many of the houses of the nineteenth century have verandas screened
by shutters or lattice, some two-story ones. These are more common
perhaps in the towns, where the houses were more crowded and the shade
trees fewer. They seem more tropical or West Indian in character than
the earlier houses, peculiarly Bermudian, and have a quite different
interest. A few are shown in the photographs.

Bermuda from its earliest history as a proprietary settlement by the
Virginia Company, throughout its development to its present condition
as a self-governing Colony, has been uninterruptedly English. What
tradition there is that has been an influence in its buildings is
English. Some of the waved and stepped gable ends suggest at first
sight a contact with Spanish America, but similar forms of gables in
the domestic architecture of England, adapted to Bermudian materials,
might well have produced the same result.

Though known to exist by the Spaniards before the English settled
there, it was never occupied by them, and there seems no warrant for
assuming there was Spanish influence at any time in the Islands.

Slave labor, cheap and plentiful, but unskilled, seems also to have
been a contributory influence in the older houses, both in their
planning and building and still more markedly in road building. Deep
cuts through rock, and extensive building of substantial walls, that in
the present day would be out of proportion in cost for the advantage
gained, are frequent. Even the more modest smaller houses, with their
dependent outhouses, butteries and garden walls, all in massive
masonry, create an appearance of permanence and solidity, that is
striking to one accustomed to the flimsier frame construction so common
in modern America.

Through the general mechanical progress of the world and particularly
through modern means of transportation and consequent contact with
the outside world, Bermuda has no longer its isolation, and has lost
perhaps much that was picturesque and interesting in the life that
formerly existed there, and which naturally and without conscious
effort had its expression and reflection in the architecture of its
dwellings.

Other activities have replaced the largely seafaring life that many
of the old Bermudians followed and the agriculture though important
has changed its character. Small farms have replaced the larger
plantations, and Bermuda exports to northern markets, vegetables,
potatoes and onions chiefly, and imports for its own use fruit and
other foods formerly produced on the Island.

A new and important source of revenue, the tourist trade, has sprung
up, has made great strides in the last years and is still increasing.
Great and ugly hotels have been built to accommodate the thousands of
visitors and more hotels are in prospect. The climate and the sea are
inherent assets and attractions of Bermuda, which may not be changed,
but there are other things perhaps less obvious that help to draw
people there, which Bermuda alone possesses. Among these and not the
least, is Bermuda's own architecture; the little white houses that fit
so well in the landscape, and which appeal to the imagination with
suggestions of a life apart from the rest of the world, one in which
peace and ease replace the confusion and strenuousness of the more
energetic North.

The number of regular winter residents is increasing, both those who
have acquired property and those who annually rent houses. Some of
these have adapted and altered older houses to modern needs, and in
the changes made have kept to the spirit of Bermuda with no loss of
material comfort. In other houses one sees changes made with little
thought or care for appearances; iron tanks perched on roofs in
conspicuous places, very much exposed plumbing, and corrugated iron
roofs, are hard to ignore, Some of the newer houses are commonplace and
vulgar, and impair the island's richness in beauty in direct proportion
to their frequency; still others, large, pretentious, exotic in style,
and out of keeping with all that makes for charm in Bermuda, are a
positive detriment not only to their Vicinity but to Bermuda as a
whole.

Bermuda's present and future needs in building can be satisfied, by
thoughtful planning, in constructions adapted in form and spirit from
the architecture that has evolved in the Islands. May those who control
future building there either for personal use or in business ventures
be persuaded that this is true--and that this will make not only for
the enjoyment of future visitors but in the long run for the material
prosperity of the Island and its inhabitants.

Inwood is a very well-preserved example of one of the earlier two-story
dwellings in Bermuda. It has always been the house of the owner of a
plantation large for Bermuda. It represents a certain degree of wealth
and luxury. Its second story has now four good-sized bedrooms and two
bathrooms. Three of the bedrooms have fireplaces with Dutch or English
picture tiles and cedar mantles. This house was built about 1650 and
was occupied by one of the early Governors when Bermuda was still a
proprietary colony. Here he entertained and transacted business. It
has a walled garden for fruits and flowers and another large piece now
used as a vegetable garden surrounded by a high stonewall, said to have
been built to prevent the depredations of wild hogs. The slave quarters
are a separate building back of the house; other individual cottages
were built for favorite slaves. Many interesting stories are told in
connection with this place.

A one-story house built on flat ground previous to 1700. It remains
today almost as at first built and is still in the possession Of the
descendants of the original owners. The cellar space beneath this
cottage, cut from the living rock, damp and almost unlighted, was used
for slaves' eating and sleeping quarters. The chimney at the east end
served a primitive open fireplace and oven. A detached summer kitchen
is in the rear of the building. All the rooms have the so-called tray
ceilings. The plate is joined at each corner with a natural bend cedar
knee. The veranda is an addition to the original house.

This house dates from about 1700 and is little changed. It is a type of
the house of medium size of that time. The bedroom--I--has been added
since the original house was built. The front shows chimneys at the
point of each hip. The right hand or east chimney probably connected
with a cooking fireplace in the cellar, remains of which are still
discernible. The flue has been cut away on this floor--leaving the
chimney supported on the roof, as is the balancing false chimney on the
west side.

Harmony Hall is an example of a Bermudian house that has evolved by
addition and alterations from a very simple original state to its
present condition, but has remained Bermudian. The original part was
probably built about 1700 or earlier. The first house consisted of
the block A, B, C, D, E, and the buttery G, and the present servants'
quarters. H and I were Kitchen Service. The house being on a slope, the
front door was reached by a straight flight of steps opposite C. The
basement was a storage space or cellar cut out from the hillside. At
a somewhat later period wings J and L were added, the original steps
removed, and an open portico and veranda, O and K, joined them. The
house at this time was occupied by a shipowner and the large basement
used for storing cargoes, etc., brought from nearby wharves. Early
in the nineteenth century the portico was enclosed by filling in the
arches and building a wall up to the veranda roof, and interior stairs
were built.

Bloomfield is a later type of house designed for a Bermudian gentleman.
Built early in the nineteenth century, the symmetrical disposition of
house and garden, and the detail of its interior show a distinctly
Georgian inspiration. It is, nevertheless, completely Bermudian in
expression, due to the smallness of its scale, the materials used and
the exterior details.
